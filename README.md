# DownStream v1.4.0

## Overview
 Super hot 100% authentic, 60% functional, 101% effort (Use this to improve your hacking skill cause it's pain in the ass to secure. recommended for beginners atleast I can feel it's secure)

Build it from scratch take it as an example to create super secure application.

Although i used fernet and bcrypt for encryption.
(Yeah not good how it handle. look the code you will get it.)

# Why it's cool
 - not forked, written by hand, just feel the pain.
 - it feels secure(emotionally, atleast).

**(Source code is written almost one year ago. so I don't feel like editing it now, that is what it is)**
